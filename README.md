# `Watchy` firmware

My fork of [`Watchy` firmware](https://github.com/sqfmi/Watchy) with fixes and improvements.

Some of them:

- fix(ui): back button to exit to menu from "Set time" screen
- feat(ui): light UI

## Install

1. Install library `Watchy 1.4.15` with all its dependencies in Arduino IDE
2. Go to `.../sketchbook-location/libraries`
3. Remove `Watchy` and clone this fork instead:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/phts/Watchy.git
   ```

   Alternatively you can clone in a different place and create symlink.
